# holbertonschool-zero_day

The term "zero-day" originally referred to the number of days since a new piece of software was released to the 
public, so "zero-day" software was software that had been obtained by hacking into a developer's computer before 
release. Eventually the term was applied to the vulnerabilities that allowed this hacking, and to the number of 
days that the vendor has had to fix them. Once the vendor learns of the vulnerability, the vendor will usually 
create patches or advise workarounds to mitigate it.
